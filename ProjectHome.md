This desktop client allows co-workers to interact in a hierarchical structured environment. Users will be able to share and manage schedules, communicate through e-mail, and access employee contact information.

The scheduling features will implement the [GoogleCalendar API](http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/). The e-mail features will implement the [JavaMail API](http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/). The contact information will be shared using JavaMail, stored in the desktop client

This [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/) project is for Software Engineering (CMSC 445, Fall '09) at UMBC. All concepts, code, and collaboration are developed and tested by George Hardigg.
